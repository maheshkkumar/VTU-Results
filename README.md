Requests is a Python HTTP library, released under the Apache2 License. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly.

Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP/1.1 — making your integration with web services seamless. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, powered by urllib3, which is embedded within Requests
